# Off the Gridâ€¦ and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design

I found Professor Boeing's work to be fascinating. As a transportation planner, I find street networks to tell interesting stories of space and the communities. Being from Boston, I am accustomed to more chaotic and non-gridded street patterns that have been in place since the 17th century, resulting from horse paths. What I think would be a great use of this tool would be to understand the relationship betwen street patterns, land use, and mobilities (physical and social). For example, in Los Angeles, South LA and Mid-City have more gridded streets, and are more residential and often lower income compared to the City as a whole. However! Places like the San Fernando Valley, West Hollywood, and Santa Monica also have gridded street patterns, but have higher incomes and more commercial areas (ok not the Valley). What this demonstrates to me is that it would be interesting to supplement this dataset with historical context and social factors to understand why gridded street patterns, either through cause or effect, form varying neighborhoods. It's clear in LA that gridded streets don't lead to dense land use or an abundance of wealth, but how are these streets contributing to land use and urban effects now? Could the easy of movement in these places lead to other social factors like displacement that change these communities?
