I am a first year MURP, focusing in transportation planning and policy, with interests in equity, critical theory, and methodologies.
I am really excited to learn some basics of coding, develop new data viz skills, and work with data. My objective is that I will leave this course being able to code and execute basic commands on any dataset that provides meaningful summary statistics.
