# Global trends toward urban street-network sprawl

I found this paper really interesting, mainly because ever since Professor Boeing's paper and talk on the history of street networks, I've been intrigured at how these historical geographies shape and influence present day inequalities. I find it specifically interesting that the U.S. has demonstrated over and over again the permanancy of street networks and their impact on society, but international counterparts continue to move ahead with poor design. Additionally, the authors mention places in Europe that are continuing to advance street network spraw, specifically places like Norway that have long been leaders in climate friendly policies. The authors also highlight a global trend where sprawl is less common in lower-income countries, but emerges almost as a byproduct of increasing wealth accumulation. This matches exactly what happened in the U.S., and while I suppose it's not surprising, it is again frustrating that we haven't learned our lesson. One of the authors' policy recommendations is more gridded street netowrks, which is interesting, not because it doesn't work, but because cities like Los Angeles and Phoenix that are sprawling metropolises have a decent amount of gridded streets, but remain car dependent. 

## Questions
1. In addition to changing street networks, what other land use or design elements should be considered as a compliment to reducing sprawl?
2. How does this work with cities that have more complex topographies? Many of the street-level policy recommendations you suggest may be more difficult to implement, so are there other alternatives?
