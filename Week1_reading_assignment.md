# [In Rio, Mapping Gunshots Can Backfire](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-29/the-apps-that-map-rio-s-gun-violence-can-backfire?srnd=citylab-justice)

## Summary
This article highlights the growing popularity of citizen-powered crime reporting apps in Rio de Janeiro. Similar to the app, _Citizen_, here in the United States, these apps allow civilians to report potential crimes or wrongdoings on an app. The emergence of these apps is highlighting a number of things in Rio, notably that residents have historically underperceived the level of crime in their city, which reinforcing many biases that exist in criminal justice. In Rio, the apps are compounding misinformed ideas about safe neighborhoods and perceived levels of crime, that local media is often the first to perpetuate. While these apps do add additional data to the city's repository, it often needs to be analyzed critically. 

## Reflection
I found this article interesting for a number of reasons. First, many of the issues related to stereotyping that are happening in Rio have been present in the US for years because of similar apps. It's something that we all know happens, but it's hard to truly root out the problem - or even fault the app - because it's much more complex and nuanced. From a methodology point of view, I find self-reported data to be incredibly valuable to research, as well as to the concept of participatory planning. But, most of it, just like in Rio, is heavily biased and flawed. I read this article to see if the government in Rio has developed any avenues to complementing this data, or working to tease out some of its issues, while still being used as valuable information. (They have not.) For my work, self-reported data can often give additional insights, especially in transportation were data is sparsely and infrequently collected. I hope that I can learn new methods to apply data with this scope to provide meaningful conclusions, rather than relying on and reinforcing its biases.
